## üëã Introduction
The Cryptomanual project started as a way of helping out friends and acquaintences who wanted to start with cryptocurrencies and knew we went down the rabbit hole 
4 years prior. We were asked the same questions over and over again, especially in peak hype cycles. Instead of telling people to buy coin X and Y
(which still happens a lot, unfortunately) we were teaching people the very basics, without shilling or promoting any projects.

## ü§ù Who are we?
We're two guys from the Netherlands with a background in Engineering and Economics. I'm good with structure, automation, detail and techy stuff and my friend is
more of a creative, curious person with affinity for the financial and economic aspects. We both share the same idealism and value the metamorphosis of the financial paradigm, which is heralded by the rise of cryptocurrencies and other converging crises.
We have come quite far so far by our lonesome but as you can see there is a lot to be improved upon and a lot more to be still written and implemented!

## üìö Cryptomanuals
Our first project was [Cryptomanuals](https://cryptomanuals.com/). This is now going open-source and we wish to expand it.
During this time, we wrote several instruction manuals aimed at assisting people to leapfrog the many obstacles encountered as they learn about Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, the internet of value and the new economy. These manuals soon become a way to document our own journey and to try map it all out. We started with the basic questions: how, what, why? These were boiled down to different manuals and had to touch on the potential of the technology to disrupt the financial system in the why part. 
I was learning still developing my LaTeX skills at the time, loved the idea of an open-source self-help manual, saw the amazing options that were
available if coded, so here we are. We combined most of our content to create one big manual for everyone's reference.

## Cryptomanual ToC ##
A quick glance into the contents and structure of the project. A full [PDF](20211028_Cryptomanual_EN.pdf) version of the document can be found in this repository.

- [main.tex](main.tex) contains the body, pulling all seperate chapters into one compilation.
- style contains almost all style configuration and most of the packages which are used (pretty sure some people are going to cry but hey, I'm learning)
- [chapters](chapter) can be found here.
- [bibliography](bibliography), [appendices](appendices), [illustrations](illustrations), [img](img), [logo](logo) and the rest should be pretty 
self explanatory.

## ü•Ö Goals & Ambitions for the Cryptomanual
The Cryptomanual is obviously a living document, especially with regard to all of the rapid interesteing developments and their broad implicaitons. The Cryptomanual should include, but should not be limited to:

- Knowledge framework to start with crypto
  - How? What? Why? Absolute basics around wallets, exchanges, transactions, consensus and more
- Origin and history of crypto and blockchain technology 
  - First useage of digital currencies, cypherpunk movement, libretarian heritage et cetera
- Privacy and security issues
- Investing and trading principles 
- Risks involved
- Trends & developments
  - DApps, DeFi, NFTs, Tokenization, et cetera
- Origins and history of money
- Basics about monetary history, currency creation and the banking system
- Centralization & decentralization
- Evolution/transformation of the financial system

Boy, can I go on with that list... Some of these topics are already somewhat incorporated but there's a lot of work to be done on all of the subjects and their relations. 

## What do we need?
In my mind, we would need help on these matters:

### üóÑ Project organization & structure
We could need help with the logical framework, github repos, LaTeX best practices, organization and coding)

### ‚úèÔ∏è Writing  Content 
Basically. anyone who is passionate about any of the subjects above or other relevant topics
and loves to write or express themselve that way, could help us make content for the project. 
I guess you must be as curious and willing to learn new stuff as we are. But either way, if you're willing to learn, that naturally
inquisitive person or already an expert, thats all great for us.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Coding
Help with bug fixes, improvements, package management, advice about structure or basically anything related to TeX itself. 
I've been teaching myself LaTeX over the past few years, improving when I was able to spend many hours on a daily basis on the project. 
Before we could get anything going, I feel I need help with the management of the repo and improving the code as I'm quite sure it's still obvious 
I'm learning by doing and loving it at the same time. ü§ü


## üêá Cryptocommunity
The second project is a social platform in the Netherlands, called [Cryptocommunity](https://cryptocommunity.nl/).The Cryptocommuntiy offers a comprehensive crypto course, coaching and guidance while at the same time providing a safe space to learn about cryptocurrencies.
We focus on problems of the old and solutions within the new paradigm. We look at long term value foremost and we do not promote specific projects. We do, however, offer frameworks to evaluate projects and look for fundamental value.

## Conclusion
Both of our projects originated from a desire to help out, learn and spread our own enthousiasm. There's thousands of people around the world all documenting their own journeys. Everyone has their own interests, skills and other matters that gets them all exited about stuff. If a few of us who prefer the slower pace of doing research and writing compaired to making video content to elevate that part to the next level, that would be amazing. 

Literally any help is appreciated.  

De groeten maar weer!
